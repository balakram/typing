spoken in so many countries and there are only a few countries

where this prestigious language is absent. It is a fact, although in

some countries, English language is not a medium of

communication among people, yet still there is considerable

Independence, teaching of Urdu was also discontinued, because it

was considered that it is a language of Muslims, who left Punjab

for good. But after a lapse of more than half a century, it has again

been decided to introduce Urdu from the primary classes.

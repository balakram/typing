The 72nd meeting of the Network Planning Group (NPG) was convened in New Delhi on 12th June, 2024. The meeting was chaired by the Additional Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Shri Rajeev Singh Thakur. The meeting focused on evaluating three significant infrastructure projects, one each from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), Ministry of Railways (MoR), and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). The projects were evaluated for their conformity to the principles of PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (NMP). The projects evaluations and their anticipated impacts includes the following:
1. National Highway Project in Jammu & Kashmir of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH)
The project involves the construction and upgradation of a 51-Km section of NH-701 from Rafiabad to Chamkot. With both greenfield (14.34 km) and brownfield (36.66 km) developments, the project is expected to cost INR 1,405 Crores. The upgraded route will significantly enhance connectivity for villages such as Kupwara, Chowkibal, and Tangdhar, improving logistical support for defence forces and boosting socio-economic conditions by providing better access to health, education, and business opportunities.
2. Gudur-Renigunta Third Rail Line in Andhra Pradesh of Ministry of Railways (MoR) The construction of a third rail line between Gudur and Renigunta stations in Andhra Pradesh's Tirupati district involves an 83.17 km line aimed at enhancing the capacity of the existing double line. With an estimated cost of INR 884 Crores, this project will improve passenger and cargo movement efficiency, requiring 36.58 hectares of land. Infrastructure upgrades will include new bridges, extended underpasses, and advanced signalling systems, significantly boosting regional economic activities.
3. Pune Metro Line Extension in Maharashtra of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) This MoHUA project aims to extend the operational metro corridor from Vanaz to Ramwadi in Pune. The project involves the extension of two lines on the eastern and western ends of the VanazRamwadi metro corridor. The extension on the western side is an elevated section of 1.12 km from Vanaz to Chandani Chowk, while the extension on the eastern side is an elevated section of 11.63 km from Ramwadi to Wagholi/Vitthalwadi. The total length of this elevated metro corridor will be 12.75 km and will be constructed at an estimated cost of INR 3,757 crores.
The daily ridership for the line is anticipated to reach 3.59 lakhs by 2027, and it is projected to grow to 9.93 lakhs by 2057. This extension will connect central Pune with rapidly growing suburbs, reducing travel time and road congestion, and significantly enhancing the city's public transport infrastructure.
During the meeting, all projects were evaluated for their integrated planning and alignment with the principles of PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (NMP). Emphasis was placed on the socioeconomic benefits, improved connectivity, reduced transit costs, and enhanced efficiency. The projects also aim to foster multimodal integration, enhancing overall transportation and logistics networks.
These projects are expected to play pivotal roles for nation-building, integrating various modes of transport, and providing substantial socio-economic benefits and ease of living, thereby contributing to the overall development of the regions.
